This program defines three methods:

The permute() method takes in a string and two integers, l and r which represent the left and right index of the string. This method uses the backtracking technique to find all the permutations of the given string. It starts by checking if the left index is equal to the right index, which means we have reached a single character, so we add it to the permutations list. If not, it uses a loop to iterate over the string from the left index to the right index, and for each iteration, it swaps the character at the left index with the character at the current index, recursively call the permute method with the updated string, left index +1 and right index. then it swap back the character to the original position.

The swap() method takes in a string, and two integers, which represent the indexes of two characters to be swapped. It converts the string to a character array, swaps the characters and returns the updated string.

The main() method is used for testing the permute() method. It calls the permute() method with a string "abc" and left and right index 0 and 2 respectively, then it prints all permutations.

The program uses recursion and backtracking to find all permutations of a given string. It starts by swapping the first character with each of the other characters, then recursively calling itself with the remaining characters, and then swapping back the characters to the original position. This process is repeated for each character in the string, resulting in all possible permutations of the input string.
