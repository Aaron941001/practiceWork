This implementation of the merge sort algorithm divides the input array recursively into two halves until the base case is reached, which is an array with one element.

Then it will sort and merge them together by comparing the first element of each half and inserting the smaller one into the result array, and then it will repeat the process until one of the halves is exhausted. This way we are ensuring that the array is sorted.

The leftHalf() and rightHalf() methods are used to divide the input array into two halves and return them as new arrays.

The merge() method takes the result array, left and right halves as input and does the merging by comparing the first element of each half and inserting the smaller one into the result array.

You can use this mergeSort by calling the mergeSort(int[] array) method by passing an integer array as an argument and it will sort the array in ascending order.
