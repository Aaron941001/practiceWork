The Dijkstra class defines a dijkstra() method that takes in a 2D list representing the graph, where each inner list represents a node and the integers represent the weights of the edges connecting it to other nodes, and an integer representing the starting node. This method uses a priority queue to keep track of the nodes to visit next, based on their current shortest distance from the start node. The method returns a map where the key is the node index and the value is the shortest distance from the start node to that node.
The Dijkstra class also defines a getShortestPath() method that takes in the same 2D list representing the graph, the starting node and the end node. This method calls the dijkstra() method to get the map of shortest paths and returns the value of the end node from that map.
The Dijkstra class also defines a main() method, which you can use to test the getShortestPath() method. In this example, the graph is represented by a 2D list of integers, where each element represents the weight of the edge between two nodes, and the main() method calls the getShortestPath() method, passing this graph, the start node, and the end node, and it prints the shortest path.
The Node class is used to represent each node in the graph, it implements the comparable interface, so it can be used in the priority queue. It has two fields, index and dist, where index represents the node's index and dist represents the distance from the start node.
The program use a priority queue to store the nodes and it will always pick the node with the smallest distance from start node.
The program uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a start node to all other nodes in the graph. It starts by initializing all distances to the maximum value, except for the start node, which is set to 0. The algorithm then repeatedly selects the node with the smallest distance and updates the distances of its neighbors if a shorter path is found. Finally, it returns a map containing the shortest path to each node in the graph.
