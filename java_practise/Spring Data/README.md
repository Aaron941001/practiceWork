This is a simple CRUD service class that uses the UserRepository interface to perform operations on the User collection in MongoDB.

The createUser method saves the user object to the MongoDB collection.
The updateUser method saves the user object to the MongoDB collection.
The deleteUser method deletes the user object from the MongoDB collection by its id.
The getAllUsers method retrieves all user objects from the MongoDB collection.
The getUserById method retrieves a user object from the MongoDB collection by its id.
The getUserByName method retrieves a user object from the MongoDB collection by its name.
The UserRepository class extends MongoRepository, which provides a simple and convenient way to interact with MongoDB collections. The class also has findByName method to search by name.

This is a simple example of how to use Spring Data to interact with a MongoDB database in a Java application. This example can be extended and customized to suit the specific needs of the application.
