This program defines two main things:

The knapsack() method takes four parameters: an integer representing the maximum weight the knapsack can hold, two arrays representing the values and weights of the items, and an integer representing the number of items. It initializes a 2D array dp where the rows represent the items, and the columns represent the weight. The method then uses a nested loop to fill the array, using the following logic:
If the current item or weight is 0, the value at that cell is 0.
If the weight of the current item is less than or equal to the current weight, the value at that cell is the maximum of the value of the current item plus the value at the previous row and the same column minus the weight of the current item, and the value at the previous row and the same column.
If the weight of the current item is greater than the current weight, the value at that cell is the value at the previous row and the same column.
Finally, it returns the value in the last cell of the array, which is the maximum value that can be obtained with the given weight and items.
The main() method is used for testing the knapsack() method. It calls the knapsack() method with an example set of values and weights and maximum weight, and it prints the result.
The program uses dynamic programming to solve the knapsack problem. The knapsack problem is a combinatorial optimization problem that asks to maximize the total value of items in a knapsack of a given weight capacity. The program uses a 2D array dp to store the maximum value that can be obtained for each subproblem, where each cell represents the maximum value that can be obtained with a specific set of items and a specific weight. It uses a nested loop to fill the array, using the logic
