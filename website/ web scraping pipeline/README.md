This is just an example, and in a real-world application, the pipeline would be more complex and would involve more steps like handling edge cases, data validation, data cleaning, and data enrichment. Additionally, you would need to set up and configure the data warehouse, such as MySQL or BigQuery, and ensure that the data is properly indexed and optimized for querying.

It's important to note that this project is a complex one, it involves a lot of steps and libraries, and it requires a good understanding of the underlying concepts and techniques in web scraping, data processing, and data warehousing.


First, you would need to set up a Scrapy project and create a spider that can extract the data from the websites. You can use Scrapy's built-in functionality to handle common tasks like following links, handling cookies and sessions, and handling redirects.

Next, you would need to use pandas to process the data and prepare it for storage in the data warehouse. This would involve cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a format that can be stored in the data warehouse.

Finally, you would need to use Apache Nifi to store the data in a data warehouse. This would involve configuring Apache Nifi to accept data from the pipeline, store it in a data warehouse, and make it available for further processing and analysis.
