The first line imports the Flask module and creates a Flask web server from the Flask module.

The second line creates an instance of the Flask class for our web application.

The third line is a configuration for SQLAlchemy, a python library that provides a nice API for interacting with databases.

The fourth line creates an instance of the SQLAlchemy class and binds it to our Flask application.

The fifth line, we are creating a Task model class that inherits from db.Model class, which is provided by SQLAlchemy. This class represents the database table that we'll use to store our tasks.

The sixth line, we are creating a columns for the table, id, title, description and done where 'id' is primary key and the rest of the columns are String, String and boolean types respectively.

The seventh line, we are creating the table in the database using the create_all() method provided by SQLAlchemy.

The next two functions are Flask views, these functions are responsible for handling request and returning response. The index() function is the root view of the application and it fetches all the tasks from the database, and renders them in the index.html template.

The add() function is a view that handles the form submission and add the new task to the database, then redirects the user back to the homepage.

In the last line, we are running the application on the localhost IP and the port 5000.

This example shows how to use Flask and SQLAlchemy to create a simple web application that allows users to add and view tasks.
