In this example, we are using the Flask web framework to create a simple web server. The get_data() function returns a JSON object with some sample data, which can be accessed by making a GET request to the /data endpoint.

In this JavaScript code, we use the fetch() function to make a GET request to the /data endpoint on the server. The server's response is in the form of json, so we use response.json() to parse the data. The parsed data is then logged to the console.

This is a very basic example of how you can use Python and JavaScript together in a web application. In a real-world application, you would likely use JavaScript for the frontend and Python for the backend, but you can use Python for both frontend and backend.

In this example, the JavaScript code is running on the client-side and the Python code is running on the server-side. The two languages are communicating with each other by sending HTTP requests and responses. This is a common way for different technologies to interact with each other on the web.
